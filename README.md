# Statistical_Data_Mining_in_R
This Repo consists of all the assignments I did for the Statistical Data Mining class under Professor Anol Battacherjee

* Each folder contains R code and a docx containing the analysis done for the problem.

* The assignments were structured in such a way that we have to create a table initially which shows our rationale for each of the independant variables before creating our models.

* We then create our regression models, perform tests for assumptions and then interpret the results to provide recommendations.

* For the final project, myself along with 2 members in my group did a project on "Factors influencing homicides in the United States"
